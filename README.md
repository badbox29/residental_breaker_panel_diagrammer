# residental_breaker_panel_diagrammer

Nothing fancy, just a simple breaker panel diagrammer I worked up utilizing AI along the way to fill in gaps in my development skills.  I am not a developer by trade and made this strictly for personal use before realizing it was actually pretty nice.  I thought I would share it with the world.  Feel free to use it, just know it's under the MIT license.

Open the .png file to see the output this generates.  Handy for me as a home owner so maybe handy for you as well.  Cheers!
