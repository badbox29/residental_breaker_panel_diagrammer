# residental_breaker_panel_diagrammer

Nothing fancy, just a simple breaker panel diagrammer I worked up utilizing AI along the way to fill in gaps in my development skills.  I am not a developer by trade and made this strictly for personal use before realizing it was actually pretty nice.  It's a single page app and can run from a hard drive - no server required.  Saves panels as .json files so you can upload them back into the app.  It also can persist panels in browser storage.  Finally, can output nice-looking .png files for printing (I put one on my panel for quick reference).  I thought I would share it with the world.  Feel free to use it, just know it's under the MIT license.

Open the breaker_panel.png file to see the output this generates.  Handy for me as a home owner so maybe handy for you as well.  Cheers!
